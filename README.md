# GMU-CYSE-465-
Final Group Project for CYSE 465

This Project is about creating a smart vehicle 3D perception demo and then propose a security problem. 

We created and simulated this demo using Autoware system that was provided by our instructor. Once we became familiar with the "environment" and understood the details and intricacies on how does this system work, how many sensors it has, what do they do and how do they work together we "played around" with different attacks to the perception stack. 

Me and my classmate Abdulla Taymour performed an ___ attack were it caused the demo to crash, look "choppy" and whenever the vehicle was visible it would drive through objects completely ignoring the sensors.
